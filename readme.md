# ü§ñ defaults

A GitHub action that sets git defaults (name, email, author) for 
automated bot workflows from secrets or environment variables.

Also defaults `GH_TOKEN` to `GITHUB_TOKEN` if empty. 

## Usage

```
- name: ü§ñ defaults
  uses: devlooped/actions-bot@v1
  with:
    # The default name of the bot account. 
    # Defaults to $GITHUB_ACTOR.
    # Set as $BOT_NAME environment variable after run, and as bot-name output.
    name: ''

    # The default email of the bot account. 
    # Defaults to $GITHUB_ACTOR@users.noreply.github.com.
    # Set as $BOT_EMAIL environment variable after run, and as bot-email output.
    email: ''

    # The token to set as $GH_TOKEN environment variable. If empty, 
    # uses the github_token input as a fallback.
    # Defaults to ''. Typically set to ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}.
    # Set as $GH_TOKEN and BOT_TOKEN environment variables after run, 
    # and as bot-token output.
    gh_token: ''

    # Fallback token to use for $GH_TOKEN if it's empty.
    # Defaults to ''. Typically set to ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}.
    github_token: ''
```

If both `gh_token` and `github_token` have empty values, the action will fail.

The additional `BOT_AUTHOR` environment variable is set to `"$BOT_NAME <$BOT_EMAIL>"` 
as well as the `bot-author` output for easy consumption.

The action also runs:

```
git config --global user.name $BOT_NAME
git config --global user.email $BOT_EMAIL
```

so that git commands can be run the resulting defaults already applied.

## Example

To run the action and automatically create a PR with the resolved bot defaults:

```yml
on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  includes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ü§ñ defaults
        uses: devlooped/actions-bot@v1
        with:
          name: ${{ secrets.BOT_NAME }}
          email: ${{ secrets.BOT_EMAIL }}
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: ü§ò checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ env.GH_TOKEN }}

      # add some step that changes files

      - name: ‚úç pull request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          base: main
          branch: bot-updates
          author: ${{ env.BOT_AUTHOR }}
          committer: ${{ env.BOT_AUTHOR }}
          commit-message: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bot file updates
          title: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bot file updates
          body: Updates made by @${{ env.BOT_NAME }}.
          token: ${{ env.GH_TOKEN }}
```

In a repository that doesn't define any of the custom secrets passed to 
the `devlooped/actions-bot@v1` action, all environment variables will be 
properly defaulted, since at least `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` *will* 
be present, as well as the `$GITHUB_ACTOR` which is used to default 
`BOT_NAME`, `BOT_EMAIL` and `BOT_AUTHOR`.

It would also be possible to just run `git` commands from a shell and 
get the same defaults automatically.
